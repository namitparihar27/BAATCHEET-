# BAATCHEET-
•	BaatCheet (BaatCheet is a full-stack real-time chat application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)
•	 Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS, Daisy UI, Zustand
•	Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose
•	Real-time Communication: Socket.io
•	Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
•	Media Management: Cloudinary
Objectives
The objectives of the proposed work are as follows:
The primary goal of this project is to design and develop a real-time chat application using the MERN
(MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, integrating Operating System (OS) concepts to
optimize performance, scalability, and security. Below is a detailed breakdown of the objectives:
3.1 Primary Objectives
1. To Develop a Real-Time Chat Application
 Implement instant messaging with WebSocket-based communication (Socket.io).
 Support one-to-one chats and group conversations with dynamic updates.
 Ensure message persistence using MongoDB for chat history storage.
2. To Ensure High Performance Using OS Concepts
 Leverage Node.js event loop (non-blocking I/O) for handling concurrent connections.
 Apply process synchronization techniques to prevent race conditions in database operations.
 Optimize memory management for efficient caching of frequently accessed messages.
3. To Implement Robust User Authentication & Security
 Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication.
 Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., passwords) using AES-256 encryption.
 Apply OS-level security principles (e.g., sandboxing, session isolation).
4. To Design an Intuitive and Responsive UI
 Develop a React-based frontend with a clean, user-friendly interface.
 Ensure cross-device compatibility (desktop, tablet, mobile).
 Implement real-time notifications for new messages.
5. To Ensure Scalability & Fault Tolerance
 Use load balancing techniques to handle increasing user traffic.
 Implement database indexing for faster query responses.
 Design a modular backend architecture for future feature expansion.
